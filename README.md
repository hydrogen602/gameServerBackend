# gameServerBackend
A WebSocket based server for web games

The objective is to make one websocket server than can track many users and games and know which users is playing what game. 
The goal is to make it so that it can be easily used to make a new game without having to worry about the issues of managing a
websocket server or identifying players, so that the game code can be given just a player and the action the player would like to perform.
